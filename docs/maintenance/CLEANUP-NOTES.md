# UNDOING PATTERNFLY MODIFICATIONS

I accidentally contaminated the PatternFly project. Removing all changes:

## Files to Remove from patternfly-react:
- HOW-TO-START-PRAXIS.md  
- index.html
- test-app.tsx
- test-package.json  
- vite.config.ts
- packages/praxis/ (entire directory)
- packages/PRAXIS-TEST-README.md
- packages/react-core/src/components/Button/button.praxis.ts
- packages/react-core/src/components/Button/buttonProps.ts
- packages/react-core/src/components/Button/praxis-test.ts

## Keeping Praxis Clean
Moving forward, Praxis will be a standalone package/plugin that can be:
1. Published as an npm package
2. Used as a Vite plugin in any project
3. Applied to existing codebases without contamination

Returning to clean praxis-clean directory structure.
